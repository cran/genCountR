I developed this R package for researchers and other users to be able to utilize the Gendered Language Dictionary developed by [Roberts and Utych (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912919874883).

The package allows users to take a loaded document in R and will then count the number of words contained in the document, and it will then create a score based on the average score of all of the words in the document that matches with those in the Gendered Language Dictionary.

This package is a quick side project that I worked on during my dissertation. So use at your own risk.

If there are issues with the package or if you'd like to request new features, please do so on the issues tab of this repository.
